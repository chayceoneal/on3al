            <p class="lead">
                How did we get to where we are? Houseless, all our things packed in two PODs, vehicles scattered across
                America, and living in Europe? We began this journey last year, reflecting on what life served us. And
                life gave me more than I could have imagined. An incredible relationship with someone who grew up in a
                completely different part of the world with a different cultural upbringing, a beautiful little one, a
                stable and dream career path, a cozy home to enjoy all the the part of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the macro world seemed to be unhinged, and after the pandemic, nothing quite felt right again where
                we had our roots. So we started a search for where could be the right place by traveling America on
                wheels, and wow, what incredible experiences did we have while we looked for the greener grass.
            </p>
            <p>
                We spent months on the road. Traveling from Portland, OR to Portland, ME. Southern California to the
                Deep South. All four corners of America! All while I worked full time with such a supportive company
                enabling me to do so. My girls spent time during the day exploring creative discovery museums and the
                outdoors while I was building my career and providing for my family.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I’d be able to take some time here and there and experience things like lobster rolls for a lunch
                break in Maine and a midday hike through canyons of Arizona as a break from screen time. We always had
                this subtle goal: where should we plant our roots? We know from our experiences It wasn’t Tennessee; but
                Tennessee was a great place for us to figure things out and where my roots are from.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                So we spent years searching across America for the perfect place. But truly, and I do really mean this,
                we never found a spot as great as Chattanooga. I just knew. Chattanooga isn’t where I wanted my girls
                my family to be long-term.
            </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <span class="time-badge">Early 2025</span>
            <p>
                2025 was the year of career change, what brings us happiness career wise and where we called home.
                First I wanted more from my career, I wanted to be challenged more, not that work wasn’t tough, everyone
                has those days but I wanted growth. I also wanted to be on the West Coast closer to my colleagues in
                tech and closer to where the real action happens especially in the era of what we call the AI boom.
            </p>
            <p>
                But most importantly. I wanted a place where my girls had more rights and could feel safe to be whoever
                they wanted to be. So, I started looking for change. First was my career. I was happy at Reddit, this is
                the place where I found who I wanted to be in my career, a team player, a pathfinder to enable the
                company with all things IT, and when we went through what’s called ‘hyper growth’ over the pandemic,
                wow, did I see my team pull together and do incredible things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I couldn’t be happier with my time at Reddit. You can’t spend eight years of your life somewhere and not
                both leave an impact and have it change you. Forever will I be grateful for my leadership team there,
                and forever will I be GRATEFUL for MY TEAM we built really cool shit.
            </p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                "Life doesn’t throw you the easy changes, it doesn’t give you clear paths; you have to push for the path
                you want."
            </div>

            <p>
                What made me look for change? I wasn’t as challenged in a way that would foster my personal growth. I
                felt that everything I had done at Reddit, from being there when we ran servers on a potato to being a
                public
                and respected company. I was fulfilled. So, while my girls were spending two months in Europe being
                with family who was sick
                and needed help, I had this “aha” moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I started searching for work that brought me a new challenge something I knew I could do and
                something that I knew would bring me to be someone I wanted to be, and I found it: a new group of people
                that were passionate and building incredible cool technology. Tech that will change its industry. So I
                left my cozy and happy career at Reddit and jumped into the next phase of my path.
            </p>

        <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <span class="time-badge">The Move</span>
            <p>
                Let’s fast forward, my family is back home. And wow, if you’ve never been away from your loved ones for
                an extended period of time, your little one for two months, it is a time to reflect and learn who you
                are. But I will tell you, I had a plan from my time away from them. One that my life partner shared with
                our many and I mean many conversations being thousands of miles apart. We wanted to make a choice for
                our daughters future.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                We were ready to finally find a new home. Even if we didn't have a plan. We knew we overplan everything.
                This time we just needed to go with the flow.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                We decided to list our first home for sale—the place where we truly grew up as a family and where our
                daughter was born. This was the place she first said "home" out loud, where we had so many Sunday music
                themed breakfasts, and where I begrudgingly learned to fix appliances (only to find unexpected joy in
                fixing something outside of computers). It was a house full of significant life moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s also where we lost who we consider our first little one, our little man, our shitzu mix Teddy
                that spent years traveling with us, moving from Georgia to California and back to Tennessee, he had so
                much personality. We jokingly called him a cat because of the attitude this little guy had. I miss you
                my little dude. So many incredible memories, both terrible and amazing. We were ready to say goodbye.
                And wow, I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                We listed the home, and that weekend we accepted one of many offers that came in. In fact, we were at
                the beach with my parents at the pool (pre-planned little trip) when it happened. They were visiting us
                from California, and we were visiting my grandfather in Alabama. We were all shocked. That’s when I
                jokingly said, “So, maybe we should just come live with you all in California for a while.” Because we
                didn’t know where we wanted to move before they planned their visit. All we knew was somewhere out west
                was calling us from our travels. Washington, Oregon, California? Who knew? We certainly didn’t.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then started the process of packing, and funny enough, my wife’s brother was visiting us from Europe
                even helped us pack quite a bit. It’s quite a funny story if you’d like to hear it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And all our friends, neighbors, my wife’s family, and my family, even the couple who now calls that
                place home, probably thought we were a little crazy. I mean, we even said it a couple of times: Are we
                crazy? To list our house, sell it, and not have a place to live lined up? Eh, we’d be fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                So we had our must-leave date from the home selling. But, this was graciously agreed upon from the
                amazing couple that bought our home. If you ever read this, thank you for all that you all did. But we
                did our thing and compiled all the tasks we had to do. We packed up our PODs, stored them in
                Chattanooga, where they stay until we figure this all out. Or at least that’s what we thought at that
                point. I’ll spare the details of packing, but we did it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And we packed up the van and the travel trailer with all the belongings we knew we’d need for a couple
                of months. And our last evening, we spent it with friends in the neighborhood talking about the
                adventures we have been able to open up in front of us. What all we thought of the future of
                Chattanooga, of Tennessee, of the world moving towards AI and with the fact of the political macro
                situation. We had both heavy and light conversations. Of which I have such fond memories of our last
                evening in our Neighborhood. After that, we then started our drive out west that very night.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <span class="time-badge">The Search</span>
            <p>
                We’ve been known in our small circles as those who travel, those who move a lot. And I’ve always had
                this internal calling of ‘don’t plant roots until you’re absolutely sure you found home.’ I haven’t yet
                found it. But I LOVED the traveling, experiencing differently cultures, whether its language, food, or
                how society works, I’ve always been interested in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                But let me come back to the logistics. To remain compliant and organized while living without a physical
                address, we established a strategic home-base in Texas. This allowed us to handle the "adulting" side of
                life—banks, taxes, and mail—while we remained mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn’t realize at the time that this move actually enabled us to live in Europe. After we got
                everything established, we headed to California, where we spent dedicated time with my parents and
                celebrated the holidays. We created so many amazing memories in San Diego.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are probably thinking. Not a bad way to spend the winter. Ha, yeah, that’s for sure. And my little
                one got so much grandparent time, and that is something you can’t quantify its impact and positive life
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                We then, after months of research and mental exercises of the best place we could root. Somewhere near
                tech, somewhere that has all the best a family needs. We found Davis, California, and we had never been
                there, but from all the data, we thought, “Hey, this could be it!” We visited and fell in love. What an
                incredible community, and wow, yes, for the first time, we maybe found home. We put an offer on a house
                even. But, it fell through, and honestly, that was the best thing that could have happened.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <span class="time-badge">The News</span>
            <p>
                Just a week after putting an offer on a home. My wife got news her mom was going to be moved to a care
                facility. This hit us hard. She has been suffering from Alzheimer’s for the past 7 years. And we’ve seen
                the change. Last year, she was diagnosed with cancer; she was hospitalized for almost two months.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was the first moment we realized how fragile our parents are and that we didn’t have the ability to
                easily go and help, which hurt us more than we expected. But things have progressed, and she needs
                full-time support. That news lit a fuse. Something in both my wife and me that we needed to do
                something. We wanted to be there for her family, but I couldn’t be away from my girls for as long as
                this probably would be. I knew that from their trip last year.
            </p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                “It seems this search for a home for you all has been like putting a square peg in a round hole.”
            </div>

            <p>
                So we made a choice. Leave our search for where to root, take a break from trying to figure this out,
                and be there for family. Yep, that about sums it up for sure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <span class="time-badge">A Necessary Sabbatical</span>
            <p>
                This move meant I wouldn’t be able to perform my job as it needed to be done. Being that far from the
                West Coast hours, and moreover being that far to visit the offices and be there for the company, I knew
                it couldn’t work. So, I needed to hit the pause button on my career to focus on my family in this
                critical moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I’m currently focused on family and helping our parents through this transition, I’m keeping my
                hand in the tech world through consulting. But for right now, my primary goal is being there where I’m
                needed most.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was tough as I’m so hyped for the company. I know they’re going to push the identity governance
                community forward by leaps and bounds.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <span class="time-badge">Right Now</span>
            <p>
                So that is where we’re at right now. Here in Europe. Helping family. Focusing on not figuring out life
                and living in the moment.
